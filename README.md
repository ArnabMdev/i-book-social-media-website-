# This is a social media website(i-book)
- This is just normal project where I have tried cloning a social media website and adding some new ideas.
- I have thought of making the user anonymous in his/her friends circle and posting and enjoying.

# to contribute in this project you can follow the following steps.
## To access this fork ans then clone it:-
- Fork it and star it , then clone with <code> git clone <repo_link> </code> command. 
- Just update the UI of the code which is in client folder, no need to change anything in the API folder (much appreciated).
- <code>cd client</code>
- <code> npm install </code>
- Then <code>npm run start</code> to start working on the frontend.
